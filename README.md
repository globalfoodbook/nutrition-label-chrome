## Description
This extension provides food bloggers the ability to add nutrition facts label to their recipe post(s) and with nutritive insights.

This extension has been derived from our code used on  [www.globalfoodbook.com](http://www.globalfoodbook.com). It is part of our drive to contribute back to the awesome Wordpress community.

Our motivation for releasing this extension is based on a forum discussion on the food-cook theme site and we felt that we already had some code that could serve as a basis for others to benefit and possibly improve on.

## Installation

1. Upload /nutrition-facts-label to the /wp-content/extensions directory
2. Activate the extension through the extensions menu in WordPress
